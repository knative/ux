<!-- Opening Outcomes for the UX WG comes with fairly large overhead, most issues should be opened as "Epics" or "Friction Points." For more information on either, consult the relevant templates by opening a new issue.-->



## Desired Outcome

## For...
<!--Which Knative users is this for?-->

## So that...
<!--What impact will achieving this outcome have?-->

## Rationale
<!--Give a bit more context as to why this is a priority. Do you have any research/data to back this up? Why is this large than an Epic or "Friction Point"?-->

## Potential Metrics
<!--(Optional, but encouraged) We want to make sure we are measuring Outcomes, do you have any ideas on how we would track that we are fulfilling this Objective? -->
