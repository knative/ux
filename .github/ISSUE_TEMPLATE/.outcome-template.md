<!-- Opening Outcomes for the UX WG comes with fairly large overhead, most issues should be opened as "Epics" or "Friction Points." For more information on either, consult the relevant templates by opening a new issue.-->



## How Might We...
<!-- ^^The title of this issue should match this heading^^

When we phrase Outcomes, we want to ensure we follow the "How Might We" (HMW) format. We use HMW because it helps us:
1. Outline the problem we seek to solve, not the solution we may have in mind.
2. Imply that this problem "may" be able to be solved, but not presupposing it can be solved.-->

## For...
<!--Which Knative users is this for?-->

## So that...
<!--What impact will achieving this outcome have?-->

## Rationale
<!--Give a bit more context as to why this is a priority. Do you have any research/data to back this up? Why is this large than an Epic or "Friction Point"?-->

## Potential Metrics
<!--(Optional, but encouraged) We want to make sure we are measuring Outcomes, do you have any ideas on how we would track that we are fulfilling this Objective? -->
