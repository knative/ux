## Improving the Onboarding Process
	
- ### Establishing a Structured Onboarding Plan
	-  	This plan should include comprehensive introductory documentation, guides, and tutorials, providing links to all necessary resources. This approach allows new contributors to seamlessly integrate themselves into the project with minimal friction.
	- 	Consolidating this plan into a centralized hub, such as a digital book or repository, would provide immense value for new contributors. Perhaps we can include this 'centralized resource' in the issue templates to make it easier to find, especially for newcomers.

- ### Comprehensive video tutorials
	- Creating detailed video tutorials for setting up Knative projects on popular operating systems like Linux/WSL and macOS is essential for new contributors. 
	- These tutorials would provide step-by-step instructions for installation and configuration, along with an overview of different components and directories. 
	- Visual guides simplify onboarding and empower contributors to overcome initial hurdles more effectively.

- ### Clear Communication of Expectations
	- Establishing clear expectations for pull requests (PRs) helps new contributors grasp the collaborative review process. This proactive approach reduces frustration and encourages sustained engagement by preparing contributors for iterative feedback. (Some contributors mentioned that they got overwhelmed by the number of comments on their first PR)


**Why is it needed?**

Many contributors face difficulties during the initial setup phase, leading to frustration and potential abandonment of the project. Comprehensive video tutorials and enhanced introductory resources offer a guided approach, reducing barriers to entry and helping new contributors navigate the project confidently. Additionally, there's a significant need for beginner-friendly resources and documentation, particularly among students who are new to Knative and cloud-native technologies like Docker and Kubernetes. Creating a structured centralized resource addresses this need, empowering individuals with accessible materials to familiarize themselves with Knative and related technologies before making their first contributions.



## Improving Issue Labeling Practices

- Adding more 'good first/help wanted' issues to help new contributors start contributing to Knative.
- Improving how issue labels are used to give contributors a clearer understanding of each issue. <!-- We can observe how this is done in the labeling process of the CNCF project, Meshery, [here](https://github.com/meshery/meshery/issues). -->

**Why is it needed?**

During interviews, contributors noted that there aren't enough easy tasks marked as 'good first' (or 'help wanted') for newcomers. As a result, new contributors often need to ask maintainers for suggestions, causing delays. Without these beginner-friendly tasks readily available, newcomers find it hard to pick issues on their own... Creating more such issues upfront and improving how we label them can make it easier for new contributors to start without needing lots of help. This might also attract more people to join the Knative community.



## Scheduled Office Hours
- Offering weekly office hours and mentorship opportunities to people facing problems.
- Anyone can join these sessions and ask for guidance on a particular problem they are facing while contributing.

**Why is it needed?**

Some contributors aren't comfortable asking their doubts publicly in Slack channels. A major suggestion to address this issue is to introduce a weekly office hour session where anyone can join and ask their questions, getting solutions in a supportive environment. This approach not only helps individuals resolve their queries but also fosters a stronger sense of community among contributors. Many open-source projects are adopting this method to enhance collaboration and support within their communities.



## Revamped Social Media Presence
- A more assertive social media strategy amplifies Knative's visibility and attracts a wider audience of potential contributors. 
By showcasing success stories, technical achievements, and upcoming events, Knative can capture the attention of developers and technologists who may not be familiar with the project. 
- Platforms that we can target: LinkedIn, YouTube and Twitter (X)
- ### Few More Suggestions:
	- Podcasts sharing personal stories of contributors' journeys add a human touch to the Knative community. By spotlighting diverse experiences and career benefits of open-source participation, these stories inspire newcomers and showcase the tangible impact of involvement. 	
	- Having a project kick-off meeting (or livestream) for each major feature we build, where we share it with community and contributors.
	- Gamification of Contributions with Badges/Certificates: Introducing gamification elements such as rankings, badges, and certificates incentivizes and recognizes exceptional contributors' efforts. These tangible rewards not only motivate ongoing engagement but also enhance contributors' professional profiles.

**Why is it needed?**

The primary goal of this proactive approach is to increase visibility for Knative and attract more newcomers. Some contributors mentioned discovering Knative through social media, indicating its potential for outreach. By boosting our social media presence and creating high-quality content for the developer community, we can generate more valuable engagement and interest in Knative.


## Engaging Monthly Community Hangout Calls
- Hosting monthly hangouts featuring interactive activities creates a welcoming atmosphere and strengthens community bonds. 
- These sessions complement formal meetings by fostering casual interactions, networking, and knowledge sharing among contributors.

**Why is it needed?**

In my exploration of Knative, I've noticed a lack of interactive and 'informal' activities for community bonding and casual interactions outside of working group meetings. By hosting monthly hangout sessions, we can strengthen our community bonds and networking opportunities. These sessions provide a platform for contributors to engage in relaxed discussions, share experiences, and build relationships beyond the confines of formal meetings.   


## Personalized One-on-One Meetings for New Contributors
- Offering individualized support (if required) through short one-on-one meetings helps new contributors feel valued and supported. 
- This approach builds trust and rapport, empowering new contributors to ask questions and seek guidance without hesitation. **The goal is to provide them with the initial support and gradually encourage them to participate more ‘publicly’.**

**Why is it needed?**

In Knative, many contributors perceive the community as comprising only one or two individuals whom they are most comfortable with. By having these trusted community members hold one or two meetings with such contributors, we can provide personalized support and guidance. This approach gradually motivates newcomers to participate more publicly and get to know more individuals whom they can interact with besides them. This expands their network within the community, fostering a sense of belonging and encouraging further engagement.

## Anonymous Feedback Mechanism
- Implementing survey-style feedback platform empowers contributors to share candid insights and suggestions without hesitation. 
- Regular review and action on this feedback will ensure continuous community improvement.

**Why is it needed?**

By gathering feedback through a survey format, we can collect comprehensive insights into the community's needs and priorities, facilitating targeted improvements and fostering a more inclusive environment for all contributors.
