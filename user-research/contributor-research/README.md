## Methods Used

To generate this report, we employed a variety of methodologies, most of which were successful. 

The main methods used were:

- **Data-driven Sampling**: We employed a data-driven approach to identify a potential user sample based on Knative's contribution data. The primary data source was the [contributors.json](https://github.com/aliok/knative-contrib-report/blob/main/250-build-contributor-list/contributors.json) file. From this file, we extracted the study sample and performed further classifications.
- **1-on-1 Interviews**: A total of 12 individual interviews, each approximately 30 minutes long, were conducted with current and past members of the Knative community. These interviews included active contributors, new contributors, maintainers, and inactive contributors. The qualitative data from these interviews was analyzed using the affinity mapping technique to identify common themes and insights. Additionally, some tree diagrams were utilized for root cause analysis to further understand the underlying issues. 
- **Comparative Analysis**: We identified some successful strategies employed by other open-source projects to improve developer experience and contributor retention. Specific examples are included in the [Recommendations.md](Recommendations.md) file.
- **Onboarding Review**: Contributor onboarding and its associated challenges were a central focus of this research. We effectively identified key areas of concern ([Onboarding Difficulties](Key-Findings.md#onboarding-difficulties)) within the current contributor journey through interviews and provided actionable recommendations based on these findings ([Improving the Onboarding Process](Recommendations.md#improving-the-onboarding-process)).
- **Literature Review**: Although not the primary method, we did read some existing literature on open-source community engagement and participation. The goal was to learn from these studies to better plan our research.
- **Surveys**: A developer survey was designed for the Knative community to explore motivations, engagement, challenges, and potential improvements. However, this methodology was not very successful or statistically significant, with only four individual responses (as of May 28, 2024). This survey can still serve as a reference for future efforts in the community. 
- **Focus Groups**: This methodology was initially planned but could not be implemented due to time constraints.


## Demographics

The primary data source of this research was the 12 interviews that were conducted within the Knative community. These interviews included active contributors, new contributors, maintainers, and inactive contributors. We analyzed contributor data from January 1, 2023, to February 29, 2024, and categorized each contributor based on their frequency of contributions:

- **New Contributors**: Contributors who made their first contribution in the last couple of months.
- **Active Contributors**: Contributors with at least one contribution each month.
- **Inactive Contributors**: Contributors with no contributions in the last couple of months.
- **Maintainers**: Individuals responsible for maintaining code in the Knative repositories.

This categorization was based on analyzing the GitHub contribution graphs of each individual contributor.

From this contributor data (from January 1, 2024, to February 29, 2024), we identified prospective participants from each of the four categories and approached them on Slack to schedule one-on-one interviews.

> When examining data from January 1, 2023, to December 31, 2023, we found that a total of 120 contributors made their first commit in 2023, of whom 8 are still contributing actively. Although we do not have an exact retention rate to compare against, it is evident that there is room for improvement in contributor retention.

Since the Participants varied in their experience levels, current roles, and levels of engagement with the project, here is some rough demographic data presented in table form:

## Limitations and Future Work

This work was completed within the 12-week timeframe of the LFX mentorship program, which imposed obvious time constraints. Additionally, there was a lack of participation in the developer survey, which limited the breadth of quantitative data. Despite these challenges, we successfully conducted 12 interviews with a diverse group of candidates, forming the backbone of this research.

### Limitations

- **Time Constraints**: The 12-week period was insufficient to explore all potential methodologies and data sources fully.
- **Survey Participation**: The developer survey had very low participation, which limited its statistical significance.
- **Contributor Categorization**: Our categorization of contributors was based solely on quantitative data (number of GitHub contributions). This approach did not account for other types of participation, such as interactions on Slack, attending meetings, providing feedback, and more. However, our interview questions did cover aspects of community involvement and interactions.
- **Data Analysis**: The qualitative interview data was analyzed using affinity mapping and root cause analysis. While these methods were effective, we believe that some further analysis of the extensive interview data could potentially yield additional insights and recommendations.


> The key findings of this research emerged from the themes identified during our analysis. For each theme, we crafted specific, actionable recommendations that are practical and feasible within our organizational context. These recommendations are prioritized in descending order of implementation priority based on our findings.

### Future Work

- **Implementation and Evaluation**: The next step is to implement the actionable recommendations and evaluate their effectiveness. This iterative process may involve trials and errors to determine what works best.
- **Further Research**: Conduct follow-up research after a sufficient time interval post-implementation of the recommendations to evaluate their effectiveness and impact on the overall developer experience.
- **Data Collection**: Future efforts should aim to gather data from diverse sources, including increased survey participation, focus groups, and more.

> Despite the mentioned limitations, the data collected from the interviews was substantial and diverse. Notably, connecting with three inactive contributors provided valuable insights. The next phase will focus on implementing the recommendations and assessing their success in improving the developer experience within the Knative community!

## Closing Thoughts


This research successfully identified key challenges in the current Knative contributor experience, along with some maintainer-specific challenges. The recommendations provided aim to simplify and enhance the experience for everyone involved in the Knative community, with the hope of fostering significant improvements.

We started this project with the **goals** of understanding the current contributor journey (please refer [Introduction.md](Introduction.md)), identifying factors that influence contributors' decisions to stay or leave, and highlighting areas for improvement. Through our research, we achieved these goals by studying the existing journey, pinpointing key disengagement factors, and proposing actionable recommendations to enhance retention.

Additionally, our **objectives**âgathering insights into the onboarding process, exploring the experiences of both retained and departed contributors, identifying pain points, investigating the effectiveness of existing resources, and determining potential interventionsâwere all met. The key questions driving this research were answered through the key findings, each mapped to specific questions.

#### Regarding the hypotheses:

1. **Positive Onboarding Experience**:
    - **Hypothesis**: Contributors who have a positive onboarding experience, are proactive, and receive clear guidance and support are more likely to stay engaged with the Knative community.
    - **Findings**: Evidence from interviews showed that proactive contributors who asked questions and received prompt support had better onboarding experiences. For example, one active contributor mentioned how a maintainer's helpfulness and clear explanations greatly supported their early contributions. Another contributor emphasized their persistence and use of some specific documentation sent by a maintainer to overcome initial challenges, highlighting the importance of proactive engagement.

2. **Perceived Value and Future Opportunities**:
    - **Hypothesis**: Factors such as perceived value of contributions, prospective future opportunities, and alignment with personal or professional goals influence contributors' decisions to remain active in the project.
    - **Findings**: Contributors expressed that their continued engagement depended on seeing tangible benefits and alignment with their goals. One past contributor mentioned that knowing about potential opportunities for advancement, such as becoming a maintainer, would have encouraged them to stay longer. Another past contributor noted that they would remain active if their work in Knative aligned with their professional needs or personal benefits.

3. **Challenges Leading to Disengagement**:
    - **Hypothesis**: Contributors may disengage due to challenges like unclear contribution processes, technical knowledge barriers, insufficient or delayed feedback, lack of recognition, community integration issues, and personal factors such as heavy workloads or limited free time.
    - **Findings**: The primary reasons for disengagement  included time constraints due to jobs or studies and the complexity of navigating Knative's contribution processes. Interviews revealed that some contributors struggled with the technical complexity and found initial contributions challenging. Concerns about insufficient recognition and the unpaid nature of open-source contributions were also highlighted. For instance, one felt that beyond a 'thank you' from maintainers, there were few tangible rewards for contributors' efforts, affecting their motivation to stay engaged. *However, issues related to insufficient feedback and community integration were not mentioned in the interviews.*

In conclusion, as we embark on the journey to enhance the Knative developer experience, I am reminded of the words of Helen Keller: "Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much..." During my time working on this project, I realized that each contributor, whether new, active, or inactive, forms a vital part of the Knative ecosystem, and every individualâs contributions and experiences are valuable, no matter how big or small they are. Each person's unique input adds to the richness of the community and helps drive the project forward!
Therefore, I truly believe that by addressing the challenges identified in this research and implementing the actionable recommendations, we can not only improve the developer experience for all but also strengthen the bonds that tie us together as a community!

Thank you to all who have contributed to this research and to my mentors who supported me throughout and played an important role in this effort.
