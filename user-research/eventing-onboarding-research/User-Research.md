## 3. User Research and Analysis

This section outlines the methods used to gather data from users, ensuring that the research approach is robust and comprehensive. Multiple methods were employed to capture a wide range of data, ensuring both depth and breadth in our analysis. Utilizing a combination of surveys, interviews, and usability testing was crucial because relying on a single approach would not provide the in-depth and nuanced insights needed to thoroughly understand the Knative Eventing onboarding process.

To ensure the relevance and utility of the collected data, demographic information about participants was considered, focusing on proficiency, experience, and industry sector.

### 3.1. Survey Design

#### Objective

Surveys were chosen to gather quantitative data due to their efficiency in collecting a large volume of responses. This method provided statistical insights into the prevalence of certain issues, user satisfaction levels, and common challenges faced during onboarding. By distributing surveys to both new and experienced users through various channels, we were able to capture a broad spectrum of perspectives, ensuring comprehensive data collection to identify patterns and trends in user experiences with Knative Eventing onboarding.

#### Content

1. **Technical Background**:  
   Questions were designed to understand the participant's level of experience across different technical domains such as front-end development, back-end development, DevOps, and serverless technologies.  
   - Example:  
     "Which of the following best describes your technical background? (Select all that apply and specify your level of experience for each)."

2. **Familiarity with Serverless and Event-Driven Technologies**:  
   Questions focused on assessing participants' prior knowledge of serverless and event-driven architectures before using Knative Eventing.  
   - Example:  
     "How familiar were you with serverless technologies before using Knative Eventing?"

3. **Onboarding Experience**:  
   Participants were asked about the duration and challenges they faced during the onboarding process, evaluating the effectiveness of the provided documentation and resources.  
   - Example:  
     "How long did it take you to complete the initial onboarding of Knative Eventing?"

4. **Evaluation of Documentation**:  
   Questions evaluated the helpfulness of official and non-official Knative Eventing documentation during onboarding.  
   - Example:  
     "Which of the following sources did you find most helpful during your onboarding process with Knative Eventing?"

5. **Challenges and Suggestions**:  
   Open-ended questions were included to allow participants to describe specific challenges and provide suggestions for improvement.  
   - Example:  
     "Based on your experience with Knative Eventing, what suggestions would you offer for improving the overall onboarding process?"

#### Distribution

The survey was distributed via email, Slack (as the primary community forum), and social media platforms like LinkedIn to target a diverse audience.

#### Target Audience

The survey targeted:
- **New users**: Individuals who had not started using Knative Eventing before.
- **Recent users**: Individuals who began using Knative Eventing within the past six months.
- **Experienced users**: To ensure a comprehensive view of onboarding challenges.

### 3.2. Interview Methodology

#### Objective

Interviews were selected to obtain qualitative insights and detailed feedback. This method offered an opportunity for users to express their thoughts, experiences, and suggestions in their own words. Through open-ended questions, interviews allowed for a deeper exploration of user experiences, motivations, and pain points. By selecting participants representing diverse experience levels, the interview process ensured a holistic understanding of the onboarding process and uncovered nuanced insights that may not be captured through surveys alone.

#### Content

1. **Technical Background**:  
   Participants were asked to describe their prior experience with serverless technologies and software development to understand the context of their onboarding experience.  
   - Example:  
     "Please describe your experience related to serverless technologies or software development before using Knative Eventing."

2. **Initial Encounter and Expectations**:  
   Participants were prompted to share their first impressions and expectations when starting with Knative Eventing.  
   - Example:  
     "Can you walk me through your initial encounter with Knative Eventing? What were your initial thoughts and expectations?"

3. **Challenges and Documentation Feedback**:  
   The interview explored the specific challenges participants faced and gathered feedback on the clarity and effectiveness of the documentation.  
   - Example:  
     "Were there any aspects of the documentation that you found confusing or insufficient? If so, could you elaborate on your experience?"

4. **Problem Resolution and Suggestions**:  
   Participants were asked to describe how they resolved challenges and to provide suggestions for improving the onboarding process.  
   - Example:  
     "When you faced difficulties, how did you resolve them? What would be the most helpful addition or change to Knative Eventing?"

#### Participant Selection

Participants were selected to ensure diversity in experience levels, including:
- Recent users just getting onboarded.
- Those with varying levels of technical expertise.

#### Interview Process

Interviews were conducted using platforms such as Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, and Zoom, with recordings and transcriptions securely stored for analysis.

### 3.3. Usability Testing

#### Objective

Usability testing was employed to observe users interacting with the current onboarding materials, identifying specific pain points in the user experience. By creating realistic test scenarios and observing participants' interactions, we directly assessed the usability and effectiveness of the onboarding process. This method provided actionable feedback on areas for improvement, such as confusing UI elements or unclear instructions, contributing to a more user-friendly onboarding experience.

#### Content

1. **Test Scenarios**:  
   Scenarios were developed to reflect typical tasks new users need to complete, from initial setup to more advanced features of Knative Eventing.  
   - Example Task:  
     "Follow the instructions to install Knative Eventing on your local environment or a cloud provider and verify the installation by running a sample event."

2. **Observation and Evaluation**:  
   Participants were observed while performing tasks, with their interactions recorded to identify usability issues.  
   - Example:  
     "How easy or difficult did you find the initial setup? Were there any specific points where you got stuck or confused?"

3. **Post-Task Questions**:  
   After completing tasks, participants were asked to provide feedback on their experience, helping to pinpoint areas where improvements are needed.  
   - Example:  
     "Did the documentation or resources help you resolve any issues? If not, what additional information would have been helpful?"

#### Evaluation Criteria

The following metrics were used to evaluate usability:
- **Task Completion Rate**: Percentage of successfully completed tasks.
- **Time on Task**: Time taken to complete each task.
- **User Errors**: Number and types of errors made during tasks.
- **User Satisfaction**: Subjective feedback collected through post-task surveys or interviews.
- **Cognitive Load**: Assessment of the mental effort required to complete tasks.

#### Ethical Considerations

Participants were informed about the observation process, and consent was obtained. Confidentiality and anonymity were maintained for all recorded data.
