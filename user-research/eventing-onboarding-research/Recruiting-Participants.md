## 4. Recruiting Participants

This section outlines the methods used to recruit participants for the research, focusing on engaging with the existing Knative community and reaching out to targeted individuals. These strategies ensured the inclusion of diverse perspectives and hands-on experiences to inform the study.

### 4.1. Community Outreach

Engagement with the existing Knative community was central to the participant recruitment strategy. The community, including developers, contributors, and users already involved with Knative Eventing, was utilized to identify individuals who could provide insightful feedback based on their experiences.

#### Platforms Used:

1. **Forums**:  
   Forums such as the Knative Eventing channels on Slack, the Knative Users Google Group, and other relevant discussion boards were used to recruit participants. These platforms enabled reaching users engaged in Knative Eventing's development and improvement. Slack, in particular, provided a space for real-time feedback and direct communication. Invitations to participate in the research, including surveys and interviews, were shared across these forums to build rapport and encourage participation.

2. **GitHub**:  
   GitHub was used to identify active contributors to Knative Eventing. We analyzed [participants' contribution history](https://github.com/knative/eventing/graphs/contributors) to detect if they had contributed to Knative Eventing in the past six months. Additionally, [a dedicated GitHub project](https://github.com/orgs/knative/projects/82) was created for this research to track tasks iteratively. This allowed contributors to follow the project's progress transparently and gain insights into its objectives.

3. **LinkedIn Posts**:  
   LinkedIn was used to reach a broader professional audience. Posts were made in relevant groups, and key Knative contributors and advocates were requested to publish these posts on their profiles. These posts invited users to participate in the research and share their onboarding experiences. This method leveraged the professional network and visibility of LinkedIn to attract participants who might not have been as active in other Knative-specific forums but still had valuable insights to offer.

### 4.2. Direct Invitations

To gather insights from users who had recent, hands-on experience with the onboarding process, direct invitations were sent to targeted individuals.

#### Recruitment Methods:

1. **New Users**:  
   Users who had recently completed the onboarding process were identified and contacted. This was done by:
   - Tracking new contributions on GitHub (see the participantâ€™s contribution history in [4.1 Community Outreach](#community-outreach) for details).  
   - Monitoring recent activity in Slack channels.  
   - Identifying posts in forums.  
   These users were likely to remember specific pain points and successes they encountered, providing valuable feedback.

2. **Surveys and Interviews**:  
   Personalized invitations for participating in surveys and interviews were sent via email or direct messages on platforms such as Slack and GitHub. The importance of their participation and the potential impact of their feedback were explained to motivate a higher response rate.

3. **Follow-ups**:  
   For users who initially responded positively but did not complete the survey or interview, follow-up messages were sent as gentle reminders. These messages emphasized the significance of their input and the impact it could have on improving the Knative Eventing experience for future users.
