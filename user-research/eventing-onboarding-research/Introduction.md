# Introduction

This document introduces the **Knative Eventing Onboarding Research** project, conducted as part of the **LFX Mentorship Program**. It outlines the research objectives, challenges, and key findings aimed at improving the onboarding experience for new users of Knative Eventing.

---

## 1. Executive Summary

The aim of this research project is to enhance the onboarding experience for new users of **Knative Eventing**, a vital component of the Knative project that enables **event-driven architecture (EDA)** in cloud-native environments. Despite its powerful features, Knative Eventing poses challenges for newcomers due to its complexity and the learning curve associated with Kubernetes and event-driven systems.

The primary objective is to identify the main barriers that new users face during their initial interactions with Knative Eventing. By understanding these pain points, the project seeks to develop improved documentation, practical onboarding materials, and streamlined processes to make the learning journey smoother for beginners.

To achieve these goals, the research combines **surveys**, **interviews**, and **usability testing**. Engaging directly with the Knative community and recent users ensures that the findings are grounded in real-world experiences and needs.

Ultimately, the project aims to produce resources that reduce the time it takes for new users to achieve competency and enhance their overall satisfaction with the onboarding process. Success can be measured through key performance indicators such as:
- **User satisfaction scores**
- **Onboarding completion rates**
- **Time to reach basic competency**

This initiative is part of the **LFX Mentorship Program** and reflects a commitment to fostering an inclusive and supportive environment for new contributors to the open-source community. By improving the onboarding experience for Knative Eventingâ€™s end-user, we aim to empower more developers to leverage its capabilities effectively and contribute to the growth of the Knative ecosystem.

Upon completion of the research, the deliverables will be shared with the wider **CNCF community**, alongside the execution details of the project, to support other projects facing similar challenges.


### 1.1. Key Takeaways

To provide a quick overview of the research outcomes, this section summarizes the most critical challenges and actionable insights identified during the study. These findings highlight key barriers faced by new Knative Eventing users and offer a foundation for targeted improvements to the onboarding process.

- **Documentation Challenges**: Users struggled with abstract language, lack of practical examples, and insufficient troubleshooting guidance.
- **Knowledge Gaps**: Many users lacked prior experience with Kubernetes, serverless technologies, or event-driven architecture, increasing onboarding complexity.
- **Verification Issues**: A clear process to verify Knative Eventing installation is missing.
- **Overwhelming Resources**: The Knative repository structure is difficult to navigate for beginners.
- **Need for Community Support**: Beginners relied on external resources or informal mentoring due to gaps in official materials.
- **Improved Training Needs**: Real-life examples, recorded training sessions, and consistent naming conventions are crucial for easing the onboarding process.

## 2. Research Overview and Goals

### 2.1. Scope Definition

The scope of this research project encompasses the entire onboarding experience for new users of Knative Eventing. The focus is on identifying and addressing the main challenges that users face during their initial interactions, improving the documentation, and enhancing the overall user experience. This includes:

#### Focus Areas

1. **User Research**:  
   Conducting surveys and interviews to gather insights from current and past users is vital for understanding their experiences and challenges with Knative Eventing onboarding. Surveys will collect quantitative data on user satisfaction and common issues, while in-depth interviews with a subset of users will provide qualitative insights. This approach helps identify specific pain points and gather comprehensive feedback, ensuring a thorough understanding of the onboarding experience.

2. **Usability Testing**:  
   Observing new users as they engage with onboarding materials will highlight where they struggle. By creating realistic scenarios and monitoring their interactions, we can identify confusing instructions or difficult setup steps. Real-time communication with participants and recording sessions will provide valuable data to address the most critical issues in the onboarding process.

3. **Documentation Improvement**:  
   Enhancing documentation is key to making the onboarding process more accessible. A thorough review of existing materials, combined with user feedback and usability testing results, will identify areas needing clarity and completeness. Revisions will improve accuracy and usability, while new resources such as step-by-step guides, video tutorials, and interactive demos will cater to different learning preferences. These improvements aim to simplify the learning curve for new users.

4. **Community Engagement**:  
   Active participation in community forums, Slack channels, discussions on GitHub, and other platforms is essential for gathering continuous feedback and building support. Engaging with the Knative community ensures that improvements align with user needs and expectations. This collaborative approach fosters a sense of ownership and encourages ongoing contributions to enhance the onboarding experience.

### 2.2. Limitations and Exclusions

- **Exclusions**: This research will not cover advanced Knative Eventing features used by experienced users, nor will it delve into unrelated components of the Knative ecosystem. It will also exclude development changes to the Knative Eventing codebase itself, focusing instead on user-facing aspects.
- **Limitations**: The study is limited to the 12-week timeframe of the LFX Mentorship program, which may restrict the depth of certain analyses and the scope of iterative testing cycles.

### 2.3. Identification of the Current Challenges

Understanding the existing challenges is crucial for improving the onboarding experience. The research aims to:

1. **Identify Common Pain Points**:  
   Determining the typical hurdles that new users face, such as difficulty understanding concepts, setting up environments, or navigating documentation, will demonstrate the points that need to be addressed within the context of this research.

2. **User Feedback Collection**:  
   Using surveys and interviews to gather detailed feedback from users who have recently undergone the onboarding process will form the backbone of the improvement strategy.

3. **Analyze Usability Issues**:  
   Observing where users struggle during usability testing and documenting specific instances of confusion or frustration will help to pinpoint critical pain points.
